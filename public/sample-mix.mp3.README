# Audio File Placeholder

This directory should contain your `sample-mix.mp3` audio file.

## How to Add Your Audio

1. Place your audio file here: `public/sample-mix.mp3`
2. Ensure it's in MP3 format
3. Recommended: Keep file size under 10MB for faster loading

## Important Legal Notes

⚠️ **Copyright Compliance**: Make sure you have the legal rights to use any audio you deploy:

- Use your own original recordings/mixes
- Use royalty-free music from sites like:
  - Bensound.com
  - Incompetech.com
  - Free Music Archive
- Purchase licenses for commercial music
- For production, consider embedding YouTube/SoundCloud instead

## Alternative: Streaming Integration

For production deployments, we recommend using streaming APIs instead of hosting audio files:

- **YouTube Embed** - Use YouTube Data API + Player
- **SoundCloud** - Use SoundCloud Widget API
- **Spotify** - Use Spotify Web Playback SDK (premium required)

This avoids hosting issues and provides better user experience.

## Placeholder for Development

For local development, you can:
1. Use any royalty-free test audio
2. Record a short test mix yourself
3. Use a silent audio file for UI testing
